  <p class="output">My journey began in Hyderabad, India. The past 20 years on this EARTH have been a whirlwind of experiences, from designing posters in my College to developing content for creating global brands. I have learned to adapt fast, be resourceful, and use empathy to reach audiences in a more authentic manner.
I am proud of my past but I’m truly excited about my future. I feel more equipped to take on new challenges and help companies connect with consumers. I believe in creating genuine, emotional ties between brands and consumers to form communities of diverse, yet like-minded, loyal customers—because connection is the most important part of any business. I also care deeply about helping teams craft their digital communication with a mix of creativity, analysis, and delight.</p>
